    <h2>Choco</h2>
    <p>Hi, if you want you can call me Choco. I got married with a wonderful woman called Celia, we have a three princess, and they know how to turn my house upside down. My wife and I were baptised in 2014 and we are very grateful to the missionaries who taught us the gospel.  We live in  Arequipa, Peru.</p>
    <p>I like to play sports like taekwondo, or runing, however I do not have enough time to practice both.</p>
    <p>I am very happy to have the oportunity to study while work with my family.</p>
